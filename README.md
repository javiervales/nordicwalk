<b> Abstract </b>  
<it>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in sports often relies on supervised machine learning with large labeled datasets, which are costly to produce. This work proposes an online unsupervised clustering approach with explainability for automatic assessment of Nordic Walking techniques using low-cost wearable inertial sensors. It identifies correct, incorrect, and cheating practices by clustering sensor data and expanding limited referee-provided tags across clusters. An explainable classifier is then trained using the expanded labels to provide transparent predictions. The system achieves nearly 98% accuracy with no manual tagging and minimal computational load, supporting real-time feedback with visual and textual explanations. This approach addresses the lack of explainable unsupervised HAR methods in sports and proves its viability in both controlled and public datasets.</it>
